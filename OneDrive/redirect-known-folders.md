# Redirect and move Windows known folders to OneDrive

This article is for IT admins managing the OneDrive sync client in a Windows Server enterprise environment that uses Active Directory Domain Services. 
  
There are two primary advantages of moving or redirecting Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to OneDrive for Business for the users in your domain:
  
- Your users can continue using the folders they're familiar with. They don't have to change their daily work habits to save files to OneDrive.
    
- Saving files to OneDrive backs up your users' data in the cloud and gives them access to their files from any device.
    
For these reasons, we recommend moving or redirecting known folders to OneDrive if you're an enterprise or large organization. Small or medium businesses may also find this useful, but keep in mind you'll need some experience with Group Policy. For info about the end-user experience, see [Protect your files by saving them to OneDrive](https://support.office.com/article/d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057).
  
## About the Known Folder Move Group Policy objects

The following Known Folder Move policies are rolling out. If you don't see them yet, you will soon. These group policies are available on the OneDrive sync client build 18.111.0603.0004 or later. The OneDrive build number is displayed in sync client settings on the About tab.
  
- [Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive](use-group-policy.md#OptInWithWizard)
    
    Use this policy to give users a call to action to move their Windows known folders. If users dismiss the prompt, a reminder notification will appear in the activity center until they move all known folders. If a user has already redirected their known folders to a different OneDrive account, they'll be prompted to direct the folders to the account for your organization (leaving existing files behind).
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Locally created OneNote files can't be moved to OneDrive using this policy. To learn how to move OneNote notebooks, see [Move a OneNote notebook to OneDrive](https://support.office.com/article/0af0a141-0bdf-49ab-9e50-45dbcca44082). 
  
- [Silently redirect Windows known folders to OneDrive](use-group-policy.md#OptInNoWizard)
    
    Use this policy to redirect your users' known folders to OneDrive without user interaction. (You can choose to display a notification to users after their folders have been redirected.) This policy works when all known folders on the local PC are empty, and on folders redirected to a different OneDrive account. We recommend using this policy together with "Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive."
    
    When you enable this policy, future releases will no longer check for empty known folders. Instead, known folders will be redirected and content within them will be moved.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Redirecting a folder points the folder to OneDrive but doesn't move any content. Moving a known folder points the folder to OneDrive and also moves the content. It should be used on PCs that have content in the Windows known folders. 
  
- [Prevent users from redirecting their Windows known folders to their PC](use-group-policy.md#OptInNoWizardToast)
    
    Use this policy to force users to keep their known folders directed to OneDrive.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > Users can direct their known folders by opening OneDrive sync client settings, clicking the **AutoSave** tab, and then clicking **Update folders**.
